# rdio-js-svg

A tiny Rdio javascript SDK client implemented with SVG graphics. Built for "performance" Hackday June 2015, this client aims at providing all UI and functionality needed for a basic HTML music player with the tiniest possible footprint.

 - HTML+SVG Graphics: < 7KB
 - CSS: < 3KB
 - JS (including Zepto): < 24KB

TODO:
 - Finish implementing shuffle and repeat
 - Media queries to scale icon sizes.
  Implement thumbs up / down as a new permission in the JS SDK.

IDEAS
 - delete zepto and use raw JS
 - Merge back into rdio-hue.
 - Use as a base for a new Chromecast receiver
