# rdio-js-svg

A tiny Rdio javascript SDK client implemented with SVG graphics. Built for "performance" Hackday June 2015, this client aims at providing all UI and functionality needed for a basic HTML music player with the tiniest possible footprint.

 - HTML+SVG Graphics: < 7KB
 - CSS: < 3KB
 - JS (including Zepto): < 24KB

TODO:
 - Finish implementing shuffle and repeat
 - Look for a way to implement thumbs up / down
 - Clean up booting logo animation
 - Media queries to scale icon sizes.

IDEAS
 - delete zepto and use raw JS
 - Merge into rdio-hue.
 - Andy Warhol style loading screen with tiled non-inline logo.svg
 - Start on Chromecast receiver
